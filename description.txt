The purpose of this project is to create a web app that displays various sorting algorithms.
It will show bubble sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, and Heap sort.

Certain features:
    - a visual to see the sort happen 'real time'
    - a button to generate a randomized data set
    - a button to start the sort

Additional features
    - some way to select the type of sort used
    - a slider to slow down the sort
    - a slider to change the size of the randomized set
